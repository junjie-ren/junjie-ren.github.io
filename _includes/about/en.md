I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral and experimental economics, and applied microeconometrics, with a focus on people's (mis)perceptions/beliefs/cognition about certain aspects of ourself, such as our self-confidence and limited attention, and how they shape behaviors in various contexts such as decision-making, investment, and business.
Method-wise, I conduct online experiments and empirical analysis to infer credible causality.
I also build simple models to derive implications that are testable with experimental or observational data.

Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a full-time research assistant at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).
I did my master's in economics at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/).
Back in college, I studied physics and economics at [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/).
