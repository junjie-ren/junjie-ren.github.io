I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).
I am on the 2023--2024 job market.

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral and experimental economics, and applied microeconometrics, with a focus on people's perceptions and beliefs of certain aspects of ourself, such as our self-confidence and attention.
Method-wise, I build simple models to derive testable implications, and run experiments and empirical tests to verify them.

Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a full-time research assistant at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).
I did my master's in economics at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/).
Back in college, I studied physics and economics at [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/).
