I am currently a research fellow at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).
I obtained my PhD in Economics from NUS, before which I did my Master's in Economics at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/).
Back in college, I studied physics and economics at [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral economics, experimental economics, and applied microeconometrics, with a focus on people's (mis)perceptions/beliefs/cognition about certain aspects of ourself, such as our self-confidence and limited attention, and how they shape behaviors in various contexts such as decision-making, investment, and business.
Method-wise, I conduct online experiments and empirical analysis to infer credible causality.
I also build theoretical models to derive implications that are testable using experimental and observational data.
